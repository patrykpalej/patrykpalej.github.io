# Project description
This project is a set of numerical simulations regarding various phenomena such as:
- Gravitational interactions
- Humans vs. Zombies battle 

## ü™ê Gravity Simulation
In this simulation, you:
1. Set the initial conditions for a group of material points ("planets")
- they can be inserted manually or imported from a file.

2. Customize the animation by multiselecting elements to display 
- planets themselves
- gravity field
- planets' trajectories

3. Determine strategy for collision handling
- annihilate
- freeze
- bounce

4. Set simulation speed

You can also save logs and initial conditions to file but only when running locally.

### Sample animations

Below you can find sample animations from the simulator:

## üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Humans vs. Zombies
- In this simulation, two groups of characters fight each other to survive
- Each character is defined by a set of characteristics, including their coordinates (x, y), velocity, and power
- When a zombie wins a fight, it transforms a human into a new zombie. However, if a human prevails in the combat, they eliminate their zombie opponent

### Sample animations
