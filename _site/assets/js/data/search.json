    "content": "A common issue in projects regarding data acquisition or frequently run scripts is the need to automate these processes. There area various methods to achieving this. The most common one is crontab. As an alternative, Windows users can utilize Windows Task Scheduler which is a desktop application for running specific executables  after a predefined trigger.For example purposes, let’s consider a bash script my_scipt.sh located in the user directory.crontabcrontab (short for “cron table”), is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.Creating a Cron JobTo schedule a task using crontab, begin by creating a file in a location of your choice, under any name you prefer. Now, you can add entries for each job you want to schedule. A crontab file entry looks like this:* * * * * ~/my_script.shwhere each asterisk position corresponds to subsequentially:  minutes  hours  days of the month  months  weekdaysThe asterisk means “EVERY minute/hour/day/…”. Instead, you can type a specific number (or numbers, separated by a comma) which indicate when the script is about to start. For example, to run the script at 5:34 PM, on the first and fifteenth day of each month, you need to enter:34 17 1,15 * * ~/my_script.shFinally, to apply changes in the crontab file, run the following command in your terminal:crontab /path/to/crontab/file"

    "content": "To round a number in Python you can use the round() function. It’s straightforward, but there is a nuance to be aware of. When you pass a number that is exactly halfway between two integers to this function, its behavior might be surprising:round(1.5)# 2round(2.5)# 2This happens because round() employs an algorithm known as bankers’ rounding (BR), instead of arithmetic rounding (AR). The key distinction between these algorithms is that for numbers of the form x + 0.5, where x is even, BR rounds the number down, not up, as it would be with AR.The reasony why to use bankers’ roundingWhen you want to round a single number, using BR algorithm might seem to have no sense, because it appears indeterministic. However, BR becomes advantageous for rounding a large set of numbers due to its statistical benefits. Consider the following set of measurements:1, 3, 2.5, 5.5, 6.5, 4, 1.5, 8Summing them up and calculating the average yields 32/8 = 4.If we round each value using (AR) before calculating the average, the result changes to 34/8 = 4.25.There is no objective reason why a number ending in .5 should always be rounded up. Statistically, such numbers should be rounded up and down with 50% probability. BR algorithm ensures this.Available workaroundsOne of the workarounds to achieve AR in Python is using int(x+0.5) instead of round(x). This method is straightforward, but the formula becomes more complex when you want to round the number to n digits. For instance, to imitate round(x, n), the formula is:int(x + 10**n + 0.5) / 10**nAnother workaround requires using decimal library:from decimal import Decimalx = 1.556precision = Decimal('0.00')float(Decimal(x).quantize(precision))# 1.56"

    "content": "One of the most common issues regarding training machine learning models is dealing with missing data. This problem isn’t just about having less information to feed the model, but also that many machine learning algorithms can’t handle missing data. In this article, I’m going to give a quick overview of the most important issues related to this topic.Which models accept missing data?Out of the most common machine learning algorithms, like: decision trees (+ their ensembles), linear models, SVM, KNN etc. only decision trees support using missing data. At least in scikit-learn implementation. When using any other algorithm, we must remove NaN values first. The most common methods for this are:  imputation  deletionNature of missing dataBefore proceeding to these methods, let’s first understand the nature and patterns in the missing data. Identifying why the data is missing is crucial in choosing the right strategy for handling it. Broadly, missing data can be categorized into three types:  Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)  Missing At Random (MAR)  Missing Not At Random (MNAR)Let’s dive into all of these categories, considering a case of a survey in which you are asked to provide various details about you, including your income.MCARThis type of NaN values occurs when the absence of data is completely independent of any other data, implying that the reasons for the missing values are entirely random and have no relation to the dataset.Example:Some respondents skipped this question because of missing it. They didn’t omit the question by intentention.MARMissing At Random occurs when the missingness of data in one feature is related to other features in the dataset, but not to the missing value itself. In other words, while the data is not missing completely at random, the tendency for a data point to be missing is only related to some of the observed data.Example:Younger respondents may be more open to disclosing their incomes, while older ones might consider such information confidential.MNARMissing Not At Random occurs when the missingness is related to the unobserved data itself. In other words, there is a reason related to the missing data which influences its absence.Example: High-income individuals might intentionally skip the income question due to privacy concerns. Here, the tendency to omit the income information is directly related to the income value itself.Meaning of the missing dataThere is also another dichotomy of NaN values which regards their meaning. We distinguish the following categories:  informative missing data  non-informative missing dataInformative missing data occurs when the absence of a value itself provides some insights.For example, if there is a missing value for the “University Degree” field, it may indicate that the individual did not obtain a degree from any university. This conveys a specific information.Non-informative missing data happens when the absence of data does not convey any additional information about the dataset. This typically happens in situations where data is missing completely at random, without any underlying pattern or reason related to the data itself.For example, if there is a NaN value for age, we cannot determine the reason for this missingness, as in fact there is always an actual value for this feature.How to deal with missing data?As stated before, there are two main ways of handling missing data:  imputation (assigning a value in place of a NaN)  deletionMain reasons to choose imputation:  The occurrence of missing values is a natural process, and the model should be able to handle them  We can explain the nature of the missingness, thus we can substitute it with a specific value  Missing data occur in many rows, and we do not want to remove a significant portion of the data  The dataset has many important features, but only a few contain empty valuesMain reasons to choose deletion:  Data is Missing Completely At Random and it’s not going to happen on a regular basis  The presence of NaN values is marginal, and their deletion will not significantly impact the size of the datasetHave in mind, that usually deletion means deleting rows with NaN values. However, if there is a feature with a lot of missing data, it might be better to delete the whole column.Methods of imputationWhile deleting data is a simple process, imputation is definitely more complex. There are multiple methods of imputation, such as:Imputing a specific valueSometimes, understanding the nature of a NaN allows for a logical explanation. For example, if there is missing data for the question “How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?” and it is known that the person is a non-smoker, we can reasonably impute the value as 0.Imputing a calculated valueFor categoric features we may impute the most frequent category in the dataset, as it’s the most likely value.For numeric features we may impute the mean or median, as it’s the most representative value for that feature. Imputing the mean works well for symmetrically distributed data, where the mean provides a good central estimate. However, in skewed distributions, the median is often a better choice as it is less affected by outliers.Imputing a value calculated in a subsetWhen calculating mean, median or mode, we can use only a subset of the whole dataset which consists of the most similar observations in terms of some other features.Training a model for estimating the missing valuesTraining an auxiliary model to estimate missing data is a sophisticated approach that involves using existing data to predict absent values. For instance, a regression model could be used for estimating continuous numeric data, whereas a classification model might be appropriate for categoric data.This approach may not always be optimal, as it can lead to an increase in the computational complexity of the overall problem."

    "content": "1. What is it?Virtual environment (virtualenv in short) is a common way of managing installed packages in your Python project.2. Why do I need it?Using virtual environments allows you to separate your projects from each other. Packages installed in one environment are not visible in other projects. Therefore, you can handle using different versions of various libraries in your projects. Additionally the environment is lighter if it contains only the packages that are used.3. How to use it?First and foremost – in a terminal/command prompt.InstallationIf you don’t have virtualenv package installed, open your terminal/command prompt and run:pip install virtualenvInitializationIn your directory of choice (execute: cd path/to/directory) create the environment. Depending on how you installed virtualenv, you can try one of the following:virtualenv my_venvpython -m venv my_venv  Note that a conventional name for a virtual environment is venv, not my_venvActivationAfter creating a new virtualenv it needs to be activated first. To activate it, run:source my_venv/bin/activate  # for Linux or Mac.\\my_venv\\Scripts\\activate  # for WindowsAfter activation you’ll see name of the environment in brackets at the beginning of line in terminal:(my_venv) your_user:path/to/directory$  If you want to deactivate the environment, just run deactivate.Installing packagesOnly after activating the environment you can install packages to it. Do it using pip install, e.g.:pip install numpyAll libs you install are downloaded to your virtualenv in my_venv/lib directory.Freezing virtualenvIf you want to share the project, don’t send my_venv folder to anyone. Instead, you need to freeze your environment by saving its state to a .txt file, conventionally named requirements.txt:pip freeze &gt; requirements.txtNow anyone can recreate the environment by creating a new one first and then installing everything from requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt4. SummaryThe workflow of virtual environments is the following:virtualenv venv  # create a virtual environment named \"venv\"source venv/bin/activate  # activate venv on Linux or Mac./venv/Scripts/activate  # activate venv on Windowspip install &lt;package_name&gt;  # install required packagespip freeze &gt; requirements.txt  # dump state of your environment to a .txt filepip install -r requirements.txt  # recreate the environment from file (after creating a new one) AlternativesThere are some alternatives for using virtualenv which are worth checking:  Anaconda – used mainly in data science, allows you to store all you need in a one big environment which can be separated from the pure Python interpreter on your machine  Poetry  Pipenv"

W tym celu stworzyłem dashboard webowy, który zawiera interaktywne wykresy.Na dashboardzie znajdziesz:  Rozkłady:          powierzchni domów/działek/mieszkań      ceny i ceny za metr kwadratowy      liczby ofert w różnych regionach        Zmiany w czasie:          liczby oferowanych nieruchomości      średniej ceny        Mapę z zaznaczonymi lokalizacjami nieruchomościi wiele więcej. Poniżej znajdziesz przykładowe wykresy dla:DomyDziałkiMieszkaniaTrenowanie modeluW początkowym podejściu modele ML były trenowane wyłącznie na danych z Otodom, ponieważ ten serwis dostarcza więcej informacji o nieruchomościach. Dla każdego typu nieruchomości stworzony został dedykowany model Random Forest Regressor przy użyciu Pipeline z scikit-learn. Przed trenowaniem modelu przeprowadzony został proces feature engineering w celu przygotowania danych.Kroki preprocessingu na przykładzie danych o domach obejmują:  Przekształcenie typu ogłoszenia (agencja lub prywatne) na wartość boolean  Przekształcenie typu rynku (pierwotny lub wtórny) na wartość boolean  Label encoding dnia tygodnia i pory roku, w których została dodana oferta  Obliczenie różnicy czasu między ofertą a arbitralnie wybranym timestampem (2023-01-01), aby odzwierciedlić pozycję oferty na osi czasu  Label encoding lokalizacji domu (wieś/przedmieścia/miasto)  One hot encoding województwa i podregionu nieruchomościZarówno do dalszego preprocessingu (skalowanie cech), jak i trenowania modelu, zastosowano grid search z następującymi parametrami:  StandardScaler(), MinMaxScaler() do skalowania cech  400, 500, 600 dla n_estimators  70, 80, 90 dla max_depthDodatkowo eksperymentowałem z ekstrakcją cech, jednak to podejście skutkowało pogorszeniem wydajności modelu.Finalny pipeline, skonfigurowany dla optymalnej wydajności pod względem mean absolute error (z użyciem walidacji krzyżowej), zawiera następujące elementy:Metryki obliczone dla całego zbioru danych o domach:Mean absolute error [PLN]: 165599.68Mean absolute percentage error [%]: 25.7Wydajność modelu jest daleka od doskonałości, na co wpływa wiele czynników, w tym subiektywny charakter wyceny domów. Model dobrze radzi sobie z kluczowymi aspektami takimi jak lokalizacja czy wielkość, ale różnorodność detali wnętrz stanowi wyzwanie. Dodatkowo model nie wykorzystuje wszystkich cech nieruchomości, co wpływa na jego dokładność. Ta wersja to początkowy krok w eksploracji możliwości modelowania cen, z potencjałem na przyszłe ulepszenia. Głównym celem jest oszacowanie wartości rynkowej, a nie stworzenie uniwersalnej formuły wyceny.API dla modeluAPI wykorzystuje spiklowane modele przechowywane na Google Cloud Storage. Wspiera dwa typy endpointów GET dla każdego typu nieruchomości:  estimate_price_from_json  estimate_price_otodom_offerKod znajdziesz w podlinkowanym repozytorium. API nie jest zhostowane ze względu na duże zużycie pamięci wynikające z ładowania zserializowanych modeli."
